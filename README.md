## 💡 Projects Overview

Each folder (mini1, mini2, mini3) showcases a different distributed computing concept, implemented with code, scripts, and documentation:

- **mini1:** Batch size optimization, distributed queue simulation, differentiation b/w Object of Arrays & Array of Objects and distributed queue processing.
- **mini2:** Fault tolerance, consensus protocols, and multi-node communication (can include election, failure handling, etc.).
- **mini3:** Advanced distributed protocols, leader election, file systems, or other cutting-edge distributed algorithms.

Check each `mini*/README.md` for project-specific usage and details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** Scripting and algorithm prototyping
- **C++ and C:** High-performance systems programming
- **Makefile & CMake:** Build automation for C/C++ projects
- **Distributed Systems Principles:** Batch processing, fault tolerance, consensus, leader election

## 📖 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/manamsriram/cmpe275.git
    ```
2. Navigate into any mini project (`mini1/`, `mini2/`, `mini3/`) for code, readme, and instructions.
3. Build/run with Makefile, CMake, or Python as described in each subfolder.
